This program allows windows users to mute all non-focused windows on the device. A hotkey can be set to toggle this feature.

How to run the program:
    Run `mono_focus.exe` in the `dist` folder.

    If the .exe does not work:
        1. Run the `build.bat` file
        2. Run `mono_focus.exe` in the `dist` folder.
